# TODOs

1. Start benchmarking my top 10 *finds* compared to S&P.
    * We don't have historical data for all the metrics we are using so we need to just start with the current data and go from there.
    * We should be saving the top 10 stocks and allocating a fixed amount of money to each stock to see how they perform over time. Every trading day at a set time.
    * Every time we buy a stock we should buy that same amount of SPY as well to compare.
    * This will require some sort of database to store the data.
2. Train model as an additional feature score.
3. Add sentiment analysis.
4. Figure out how to gate top 10 for premium users.
5. Setup way to have "premium" users.
