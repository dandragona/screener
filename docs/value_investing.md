# Value Investing Screening & Strategy Guide (8-24 Month Horizon)

This document outlines research-backed strategies and screening criteria for finding value stocks with an expected holding period of 8-24 months. This medium-term horizon requires a balance of deep value (margin of safety) and potential catalysts for value realization.

## 1. Core Quantitative Screening Criteria

For an 8-24 month timeframe, you want to identify companies that are statistically cheap but healthy enough to survive and ideally re-rate.

### Valuation Metrics
*   **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)**: Look for companies trading below their historical average or industry peers. A common benchmark involves a P/E < 15, but strictly relative to growth (see PEG).
*   **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book)**: P/B < 1.0 or 1.2 suggests the stock is trading near or below its net asset value. This is a classic "deep value" signal.
*   **P/FCF (Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow)**: A P/FCF < 12 is often a strong indicator. Cash flow is harder to manipulate than earnings.
*   **EV/EBITDA**: A more capital-structure-neutral metric. Look for low values relative to the industry.

### Financial Health & Safety
*   **Debt-to-Equity**: Low or manageable debt is critical to reduce bankruptcy risk during your holding period. Look for D/E < 0.5 or industry-appropriate levels.
*   **Current Ratio**: > 1.5 to ensure liquidity (ability to pay short-term obligations).
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio**: > 5x suggests the company can comfortably pay interest on its debt.

### Profitability & Quality
*   **ROE (Return on Equity)**: High and stable ROE (e.g., > 15%) indicates efficient management capital allocation.
*   **FCF Yield**: A high Free Cash Flow Yield (e.g., > 5-7%) allows the company to buy back shares, pay dividends, or reinvest, all of which support the stock price.

## 2. Qualitative Factors & Catalysts

For a medium-term hold (8-24 months), "cheap" isn't enough; you need a reason for the price to correct. avoiding "value traps" is key.

### The "Moat" (Competitive Advantage)
*   **Pricing Power**: Can they raise prices without losing customers?
*   **High Switching Costs**: Is it hard for customers to leave?
*   **Network Effects**: Does the service get better with more users?

### Catalysts (The Engine for Re-rating)
A catalyst is an event that forces the market to re-evaluate the stock price.
*   **Corporate Actions**: Spinoffs, asset sales, or share buybacks.
*   **Management Changes**: New CEO or activist investor involvement.
*   **Industry Turnaround**: Cyclical bottoms where supply/demand dynamics are shifting.
*   **Regulatory Changes**: Resolution of lawsuits or favorable policy shifts.

## 3. Specific Strategies

### A. GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price)
Best for capturing upside in solid companies without overpaying.
*   **Screening Formula**:
    *   **PEG Ratio (P/E divided by Growth Rate)**: < 1.0 (Ideal) or < 1.5 (Acceptable). This is the "Holy Grail" metric for GARP.
    *   **Earnings Growth**: Consistent 10-20% growth (avoid unsustainable hyper-growth > 30%).
    *   **P/E**: Moderate (e.g., 15-25x), avoiding the highest fliers.

### B. Net-Net (The "Benjamin Graham" Deep Value)
High risk/high reward, targeting liquidation value. Harder to find in 2025 but viable for contrarians.
*   **Formula**: Market Cap < (Current Assets - Total Liabilities).
*   **The Play**: You are buying current assets (cash, inventory, receivables) for free, effectively paying nothing for the long-term assets and business operations.
*   **Timeframe**: Often works well within 1-2 years as the market corrects the extreme mispricing or the company liquidates/is acquired.

### C. The "Acquirer's Multiple" (Deep Value)
Based on Tobias Carlisle's strategy.
*   **Formula**: Rank stocks by **EV/EBIT (Enterprise Value / Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)**.
*   **Concept**: Buys operating earnings cheaply. It ignores the capital structure (debt/cash) to find pure operating value. Often uncovers unsexy but cash-rich businesses.

## 4. Summary Checklist for your 8-24 Month Portfolio

1.  **Is it cheap?** (P/E, P/B, or EV/EBIT in the bottom quintile of peers?)
2.  **Is it safe?** (Can they pay their debts? Current Ratio > 1.5?)
3.  **Is it quality?** (Are they generating real cash? FCF positive?)
4.  **Why now?** (Is there a catalyst in the next 6-12 months? New product, management change, cyclical low?)
5.  **The "Sleep Well" Test**: If the market closes for 2 years, would you be happy holding this business?
